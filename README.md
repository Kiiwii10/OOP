# OOP
The course takes a comparative approach to object-oriented programming in different languages, covering topics such as: objects, classes, inheritance, polymorphism, generics etc.

## Homework 1 - Squeak Basics
In this exercise, we will deal with the use of polymorphism in Squeak, and examine two types of implementations. The polymorphisms we will examine are parametric polymorphism, instantiations, and not bounded by types.
The advanced polymorphisms will be numbers that are integers only, and the examples will be numbers that are integers only, and advanced polymorphisms will be numbers that are integers only (Integer), and will not require large numbers. This requirement splits into two parts.

## Homework 2 - Java Basics
In this exercise, you will implement a social network of Technion students, allowing students to create social connections with each other, rate restaurants near the Technion, receive recommendations from friends about restaurants, and more.

## Homework 3 - Squeak Advanced
We would like to add to Squeak a mechanism that will perform type checking on arguments passed to methods and verify that the method behaves correctly.

Since Squeak is a dynamic language, we cannot check type restrictions at compile-time. Because we don't know which types the parameters will have during execution, we will therefore enforce type checking at run-time (from the context of the exercise).
Java (and C#) decided to replace multiple inheritance by using interfaces. In Java, inheritance is limited to one superclass only, but implementation can be achieved through multiple interfaces. Thus, a class can commit to interface with multiple interfaces, and thus a class can commit to comply with many interfaces and thereby streamline its functionality as required.
In this exercise, we will add our version of interfaces to Squeak, under the constraints of dynamic languages.

## Homework 4 - Java Advanced
In this exercise, we will develop a small framework for unit testing. Behavior-driven development (BDD) is a methodological software development approach based on TDD (Test-Driven Development). The idea in TDD is to write unit tests in code before writing the code itself. Both the tests and the unit tests are written using a testing framework intended to run the unit tests automatically, such as JUnit.

In this exercise, we will develop a small unit testing framework that can be used to run tests using the BDD approach.

## Homework 5 - C++
In this exercise, we will practice the advanced capabilities of C++. The exercise consists of two parts, each dealing with different topics. In the first part, we will implement an event manager in C++, similar to the event manager in C#. The second part will involve using template meta-programming to develop a language for game creation, which will be compiled and produce the result at run-time.
